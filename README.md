# AskMe - Dev Frontend 

Find yo pro is a web app made with reactJs, redux and styled components for search gitHub users and repositories data.
Is was a chalenge deal with the search limit but as soon as possible it might have the register with github option that would really complete this project.

## Getting Started

For to have this project running on your computer you just need to clone the the repo and run $ yarn or $ npm install.

### Prerequisites

First of all you will need NodeJs, a browser that can run V8 engine like Chrome and a packege manager like NPM (but I strongly recommend to use Yarn)


[Get Node Here](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

[Get Yarn Here](https://yarnpkg.com/) 


## Installing

To open the Dev mode you need to clone the repo, install and initialize.

### install;

Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned repo folder and install the dependencies with this command line;

```
$ npm install    (or)       $ yarn 
```
(wait till finished)

### run the app;

Now open another terminal and past the following command line;

```
$ npm run start   (or)       $ yarn start
```

Now the application is running. It will open on your browser.(if not just open http://localhost:3000/ and wait till load)
